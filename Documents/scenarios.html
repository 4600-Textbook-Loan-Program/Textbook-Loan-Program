	<h1>Textbook Loan Program Scenarios</h1>
	<div class="sections">
		<h2>Scenarios</h2>
		
		<p><span class="scenario-title">Scenario 1: User Login and Profile Management</span><br>
			A student logs into the system using their university credentials through a secure authentication process. Upon successful login, they navigate to their profile page, where they can view their personal details, current textbook loans, and loan history. The student decides to update their contact information and change their password for added security. The system verifies and saves the updates, ensuring a smooth user experience.</p>
		
		<p><span class="scenario-title">Scenario 2: Searching for a Textbook</span><br>
			A student is preparing for an upcoming course and needs a specific textbook. They use the search functionality to look up books by entering the title, author, or ISBN. The system displays a list of matching results, including the book's availability status, edition details, and a brief summary.</p>
		
		<p><span class="scenario-title">Scenario 3: Reserving a Book</span><br>
			A student finds the textbook they need but discovers that all copies are currently checked out. They place a hold on the book through the reservation system. The system confirms their reservation and notifies them via email when the book is returned and available for pickup. The student can track their reservation status through their dashboard.</p>
		
		<p><span class="scenario-title">Scenario 4: Borrowing a Book</span><br>
			A student visits the location where the program is being run and uses their student ID to check out a book. The administrator scans the book's barcode, and the system logs the loan, assigning a return date. The student receives an email confirmation with the due date and a reminder notification before the return deadline.</p>
		
		<p><span class="scenario-title">Scenario 5: Returning a Book</span><br>
			A student returns their borrowed textbook at the location of the program. The administrator scans the books barcode, and the system updates the inventory in real-time. If there are any damages or holds, the student is informed immediately.</p>
		
		<p><span class="scenario-title">Scenario 6: Late Return Notification</span><br>
			A student forgets to return a book by the due date. The system automatically generates an overdue notification and sends reminders via email. The student logs into their account to check the overdue textbook and decides to return the book as soon as possible. If the book is not returned within an extended grace period, additional penalties may apply.</p>
		
		<p><span class="scenario-title">Scenario 7: Administrator Managing Inventory</span><br>
			An administrator logs into the system with admin privileges to manage the textbook inventory. They add new books to the database, update records for existing books, and remove outdated or damaged books. The system provides a dashboard with real-time statistics on book availability, active loans, and recent transactions.</p>
		
		<p><span class="scenario-title">Scenario 8: Generating Reports</span><br>
			An administrator needs to review the textbook loan statistics for the past semester. They generate a report that includes the total number of books borrowed, overdue returns, and popular titles. The report helps administrators make data-driven decisions about purchasing additional copies of high-demand books.</p>
		
		<p><span class="scenario-title">Scenario 9: Secure Data Access and Compliance</span><br>
			A security audit is conducted to ensure compliance with FERPA regulations. The system restricts access to personal student data, ensuring that only authorized administrators can view sensitive information. </p>
		
		<p><span class="scenario-title">Scenario 10: System Downtime and Maintenance</span><br>
			The textbook loan system undergoes scheduled maintenance to update security features and improve performance. During this time, students and administrators are unable to access the platform. A notification is sent in advance, informing users about the downtime and expected restoration time. However, if an unexpected issue arises, the maintenance period extends beyond the planned window, causing disruptions in book reservations, checkouts, and returns. Administrators work quickly to resolve the problem and restore access while keeping users informed of the system status.</p>
